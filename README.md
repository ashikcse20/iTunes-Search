This contents is the installation manual for iTunes Content Searching API by NodeJS (MEAN STACK). 
This Project Will Search content from itunes. Install mongoDb>> ceate folder in "C:\data\db" and run
mongod.exe from the mongoDb installation drive like enter in "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.0\bin" and then click "mongod.exe" . After that install Node.JS. Then From Command promt go to this cloned folder
"iTunes-Search-master". Or in the unzipped folder "iTunes-Search-master". Then run command prompt as "Run as administrator". And then type and run "npm install" . Then run  "node server.js". Then go to your browser address bar. Type localhost:80 or only localhost and enter.In the big search box write "ramadan" or any words. And click the search button.
Don't press Enter. Because by angularJs we didn't gave the functionality with key board for searching. Just click by mouse or touchpad. And you will see your desired music categorized by song, artist, album tab. Click on of the tab and get your desired link by clicking in the <a> anchor tag text. Thanks.
